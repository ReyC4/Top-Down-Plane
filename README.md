## 🔴About
My project is a top-down shooter game set on Earth, where players control a spaceship fighting against an alien invasion. Players navigate their spaceship through waves of alien attacks, facing various enemies and obstacles. The game features diverse environments such as destroyed cities, forests, and deserts, offering visual variety and strategic challenges. Players can shoot and defeat enemies, progressing through levels by eliminating all alien threats, providing a thrilling and immersive experience.

As players advance, they can upgrade their spaceship with different weapons and special abilities, creating a dynamic and intense gameplay experience. The game aims to deliver a blend of fast-paced action and strategy, with captivating graphics and a deep storyline about humanity's battle to defend Earth from alien threats. Each upgrade and new ability not only enhances the spaceship's performance but also adds layers of excitement and depth to the gameplay, ensuring that players remain engaged and challenged throughout their journey.
